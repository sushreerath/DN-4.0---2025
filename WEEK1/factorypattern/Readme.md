FactoryMethodPatternExample
This project demonstrates the implementation of the "Factory Method Pattern" in Java.

Exercise Objective:
You are developing a document management system that needs to create different types of documents (e.g., Word, PDF, Excel). Use the Factory Method Pattern to achieve this.

What�s Implemented:
1. ConcreteClass Interface
Defines a method check() which is implemented by all types of document classes.

2. Document Types:
WordDocument � prints message for a Word file
PdfDocument � prints message for a PDF file
ExcelDocument � prints message for an Excel file
Each of these implements ConcreteClass.

3. Abstract Factory:
DocumentFactory � declares abstract method createDocument().
4. Concrete Factories:
WordFactory
PdfFactory
ExcelFactory
Each overrides createDocument() and returns the appropriate document object.

5. Test Class:
TestClass creates instances using the respective factories and calls their check() methods to display messages.
Output
This is a Word Document file... This is a PDF document file... This is an Excel document file...
